# Preface

The Web App is going to be a series of pages broken down into react components

I recommend doing a littttle bit of research before deep diving into styling different components, but it is very similar to HTML and the js you have seen before!

I have broken down the pages into the main components that we are probably going to need. Follow the FIGMA if you want to be able to visualize before you code.

PICK A COMPONENT: If someone is working on a component, <strong>DO NOT TOUCH THAT COMPONENT WITHOUT ASKING FIRST!!!!</strong> This will be noted in the issues section of GitHub where each component is a separate issue. I understand that not everyone can finish each component on their own as they require a lot of cross communication, so we will start from smallest to largest

Each Component has a small description of what it is and what it is for, but if you have questions, feel free to DM me on discord @UhOhGio

# Structure Overview

## Legend
 -> Independant Components do not require communication and can be worked on without interfering with other components. 

 -> a + b + ... -> z means that components a, b, and so on must be completed before component z

    Header
    Footer 
    LandingPageHero

## Login Page
    LoginPage

## SignUp Page
    SignUpPage // Contingent: may need to have a separate one so that we can distinguish who is signed in as a shelter vs prospective pet parent OR We can have a contact us button to manualy add shelters to our database this way we can confirm who is a shelter and who isnt to allow those types of permissions
